# MergeSort
A culmination of the basic skills learned through the tutorials completed for the NICE Project. 

```
##Assignment 1

In this assignment, we wane to put everything we have learned so far to use. You should create your own github repository and name it MergeSort. You are required to implement merge sort in c++ ([reference code](https://gist.github.com/mycodeschool/9678029)), write the CMakeLists.txt, write tests using google test as well as using cpplint.py to check your code style.

To compile and run the tests of your code, we should be able to go to build directory and do: make
make test

Your program should be able to take in an integer unsorted array and change it to an integer sorted array. You donâ€™t need to print out the sorted array, instead, just use tests to verify that the array is sorted.

Test cases:

1.
- Unsorted Array: [0]
- Sorted Array: [0]

2.
- Unsorted Array: [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
- Sorted Array: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

3.
- Unsorted Array: [8,8,8,8,8,8]
- Sorted Array: [8,8,8,8,8,8]

4.
- Unsorted Array: [ ]
- Sorted Array: your program should report that the array is empty and abort the execution
